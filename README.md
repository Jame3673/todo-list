# TO DO terminal app

- This is a simple project make by Python
- For short, it a terminal app can create a list tasks
- I'm an freshman so if someone saw this project I hope you guys will like it

## Features

This is all feature the app can do:
1. add -> add new task
2. list -> list all task
3. done -> tick the task
4. remove -> remove a task
5. reset -> clear the list

## How to use

NOTE: I don't know how to call the app with short name at anywhere so it will have a little inconvenient
Command:
python main.py add "TASK"

python main.py list

python main.py done ID --> the ID start from 1. For instance, python main.py remove 1

python main.py remove ID --> the ID start from 1. For instance, python main.py remove 1
python main.py rem ID --> for short

python main.py reset
python main.py res --> for short
